# Bank-Marketing-Analysis

## Objective
The objective of this project is to identify which existing customers are most likely to open a term deposit account. The analysis focuses on understanding the factors that influence customer conversions during the 2017 telemarketing campaign. By finding these driver variables and customer patterns, the goal is to help the bank plan future campaigns in a more efficient and cost-effective way.

## Problem Statement

The Bank of Corporate ran a telemarketing campaign in 2017 to promote term deposits among its existing customers. While the campaign generated responses, the bank does not clearly understand which customers are most likely to convert or which factors influence the success of such campaigns. Without this clarity, future marketing efforts may lead to high costs and low returns.

The problem is to analyse the campaign dataset, uncover the patterns that drive customer conversions and build an optimised approach that can guide the bank in targeting the right customers for future term deposit campaigns.

## Approach

1. **Data Understanding**
   Started by reviewing the dataset to understand the structure, variable types and data quality. Checked for missing values, outliers and inconsistencies.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   Explored customer demographics, account information and campaign-related variables. Looked for patterns, relationships and trends that might influence whether a customer opens a term deposit.

3. **Feature Analysis**
   Identified key driver variables by studying how different factors such as age, job type, balance, campaign duration and previous interactions affect the conversion rate.

4. **Segmentation of Potential Customers**
   Grouped customers based on behaviour and characteristics to understand which segments have a higher likelihood of converting.

5. **Optimisation Insights**
   Used insights from EDA to propose an optimised strategy for targeting the right customers in future campaigns, focusing on reducing costs and improving conversion rates.

6. **Final Recommendations**
   Summarised findings and provided data-backed suggestions for building a more effective marketing plan for term deposits.
